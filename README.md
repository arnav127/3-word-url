# 3 Word URL

Make easy to pronounce and share short URLs to share on the go.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember times when you are working on a development project and urgently need to share a link with the person on the other desk?
Generating a bitly for that doc page isn't really feasible since you need a temporary URL, and who remembers the weird alphabets anyway?

3 Word URL allows to make short, easy to remember, _temporary_ links on easily.
